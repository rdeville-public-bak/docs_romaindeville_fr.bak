# Syntax Guide

!!! info  "Disclaimer"
    This page is heavily inspired of [Google Style Guides][google_style_guide] most part come directly from it.

[google_style_guide]: https://google.github.io/styleguide/

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This page links to the
style guidelines I use for my project. If you are modifying a project that
originated from me, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides
that apply to that project.

For now, style guides are defined for:

  - [Shell Scripts][shell_script_style_guide]
  - [Documentation Guide][doc_guide]

[shell_script_style_guide]: shellguide.md
[doc_guide]: doc_guide/index.md
