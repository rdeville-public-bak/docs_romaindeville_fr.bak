# Developers Guide

Welcome to the developers guidelines. Here is the starting point to anyone who
want to contribute to any of my projects.

First thing to check is the [Developers Guidelines][dev_guidelines] which
provides you a description of the workflow I use when developping my project. In
this page, you will also find a basic [workflow tutorial][workflow_tuto].

Then, depending on the project and so the code languages use check the [Syntax
Guide][syntax_guide], which define "style" to applied to code files.

Finally, you can see the [Tutorials][tutorial] section which provides basic
tutorials common to all my projects.
